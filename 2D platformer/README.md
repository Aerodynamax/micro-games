### current working story
The story goes that your an explorer who came
across a strange surface in a surreal forest, however, 
upon standing on the thing to get a better look at it, it 
crumbles, revealing an expansive tomb with a web of interconnected 
rooms and hallways sprawling out in every direction.  This
game follows just one of the paths the tomb had, maybe 
future games or expasion packs (made by me or [others](#developer-guide)) 
could expand on these unseen pathways.
